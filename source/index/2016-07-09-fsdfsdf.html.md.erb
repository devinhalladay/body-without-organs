This project began with a book I produced last year, entitled [*The Book of Caesurae: or, How to Philosophize with Scissors*](https://devinhalladay.com/work/book-of-caesurae/).

The caesura is a rupture in time, a pregnant moment: still, yet pluripotential. From it, all potentials unravel and become. In a sense, a caesura is a genesis: a microcosm from which all other events radiate. It is a moment of deep, prescient awareness of state and condition.

This project is an *infinite* caesura. Written by [Devin Halladay](https://devinhalladay.com), this is a space for critical, radical, and speculative thought. Its purpose is to develop a holistic critical inquiry into the condition of the contemporary world and mind, delivering entries in the form of essays and aphorisms.

Put another way, this space (or blog, if you prefer) is intended to generate concepts that are themselves generative --- active concepts which produce worlds in and of themselves, and which constitute a relational canon of concepts and ideas that act as a critical framework for understanding a world that is in a constant state of crisis.
